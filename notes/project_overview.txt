Project Name:

Explainable Local Wildfire Risk Intelligence System

Problem:

Wildfires cause severe environmental damage, economic loss, and threats to human life.
Identifying high-risk wildfire conditions at a local and regional level is challenging,
especially in areas that require continuous and careful surveillance due to climate variability
and changing weather patterns.

Solution:

This project uses historical wildfire records combined with weather data to assess wildfire risk 
based on current environmental conditions. A Random Forest machine learning model is used to 
generate a risk score and classify areas into risk levels. 
The system also provides explainable insights by highlighting the key weather factors—such as 
wind speed, humidity, and temperature—that contribute most to the predicted risk.

Why It Is Unique:

Unlike traditional prediction systems that provide only a risk label, this system focuses on 
explainability and local context. It helps users understand why a specific area requires closer 
surveillance by clearly showing how individual environmental factors influence wildfire risk. 
This improves trust and usability for decision-makers.

Users:

Local and regional authorities
Disaster management and emergency response teams
Environmental researchers and planners

Real-World Impact:

By identifying areas that need to be monitored more carefully, this system can support early planning, 
resource allocation, and preventive measures. 
It serves as a decision-support tool that helps stakeholders prioritize surveillance efforts in 
wildfire-prone regions, potentially reducing damage through timely awareness and preparedness.

What the System Does NOT Claim:

This project does not claim to provide real-time wildfire alerts or automatic emergency responses. 
It is designed as an offline, data-driven risk assessment and decision-support system.
